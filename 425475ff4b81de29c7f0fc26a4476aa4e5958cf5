Use projectile instead of rinari.

I moved all my gems to vendor after reading
http://ryan.mcgeary.org/2011/02/09/vendor-everything-still-applies/
And Rinari went horribly slow on find-files since it started scanning
vendor directory as well. I tried projectile and it was blazing fast!
Moving to projectile now and its good.
